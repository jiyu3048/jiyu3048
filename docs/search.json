Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "Medical Scribe\nDuring my last undergraduate year, I worked as a medical scribe at an emergency department in Downtown Denver. This provided valuable experience in many different aspects of healthcare, including with the Epic EHR system, medical records, ED workflow, and multitasking in a hectic environment. This invariably development my interests in medicine and further expanded my appreciation for the variety of healthcare workers I worked with.\n\n\nMedical Assistant\nAfter completing my undergraduate studies, I worked as a medical assistant for a pain management clinic. This provided a more hands-on experience in interacting with patients, attending to their needs, and ensuring proper collection of pertinent medical history. This opportunity also gave me a glimpse into opioid medication and the issues surrounding their dispersal and usage.\n\n\nFuture Interests\nThough I don’t have specific research or professional interests in mind at this point, I hope to determine what I’d like to pursue moving forward while I am a student. Currently, some of my potential research interests relate to my past experiences and would include preventable ED visits/ED workflow, opioid medication and usage, and sleep."

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
