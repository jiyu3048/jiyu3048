This provided valuable experience in many different aspects of healthcare, including with the Epic EHR system, medical records, ED workflow, and multitasking in a hectic environment. This invariably development my interests in medicine and further expanded my appreciation for the variety of healthcare workers I worked with.\n\n\nMedical Assistant\nAfter completing my undergraduate studies, I worked as a medical assistant for a pain management clinic. This provided a more hands-on experience in interacting with patients, attending to their needs, and ensuring proper collection of pertinent medical history. This opportunity also gave me a glimpse into opioid medication and the issues surrounding their dispersal and usage.\n\n\nFuture Interests\nThough I don’t have specific research or professional interests in mind at this point, I hope to determine what I’d like to pursue moving forward while I am a student. Currently, some of my potential research interests relate to my past experiences and would include preventable ED visits/ED workflow, opioid medication and usage, and sleep."

    "text": "Reflection on Statistical Significance and P &lt; 0.05 - 2025\nPrior to starting graduate school this past fall (Fall 2024), much of my statistical knowledge and experience stemmed from high school level courses. Among the material covered in those courses, perhaps my main takeaway revolved around the notion of statistical significance, its role in evaluating results, and how widespread its usage was in the literature. Of course at the time, I also learned how the 0.05 cutoff was arbitrarily made and that statistical significance doesn’t necessarily constitute clinical significance. Even so I begrudgingly accepted this standard under the notion that “this concept is utilized in professional work and therefore I will adopt it too”. Learning more about statistical significance in graduate school and through reading the editorial “Moving to a World beyond ‘p &lt; 0.05’” by Wasserstin, Schirm, and Lazar made me realize how dangerous it was to implement this concept so deeply into introductory level statistics courses, especially considering how readily many other students may have accepted it just as I did. Because of this, I’d like to briefly discuss statistical significance today, motivated mainly by the information discussed in the editorial.\nOne major mistake made when interpreting statistical significance is making it black and white in nature, meaning a certain result will be categorized as either statistically significant or not. This is then further simplified into being interesting/significant results vs. uninformative/insignificant results. As quoted from the editorial, “a label of statistical significance does not mean or imply that an association or effect is highly probable, real, true, or important”. Data analysis will rarely be simplified to such a binary conclusion where a result is either completely supporting a conclusion or not. This can be attributed to the variation or noise in the data, biases and limitations in data collection, and unforeseen complications that may surface throughout the project. The notion of statistical significance rejects all of these considerations in favor of a rigid conclusion. I believe that this simplification may have contributed to another misconception that statistics offers a clean and easy way to make decisions based on the given data. Though statistics can be a valuable tool to learn from data, we must not forget to accept that uncertainty exists in the data and keep an open mind about the results garnered. Under the current paradigm, promising/statistically significant results act somewhat like a standard to publishing papers or validating your hypothesis. Once again, this encourages a rigid thought process that neglects all the variation that can exist in the data on top of the openness needed when interpreting your results. This potentially also limits openly thinking about how to refine your methods for future applications or experiment replication.\nThe editorial additionally calls for the complete abandonment of the term “statistical significance”, despite knowing that the shift will be lengthy and arduous considering its deep implementation into our education system and standards for research literature. So by discussing this today, I hope to contribute to this cause and hopefully assist those who may have adopted an inaccurate notion about statistical significance just as I once did."
